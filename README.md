media-tools
===========

Home media center automation for filing. Uses [Filebot](http://filebot.net) and 
[beets](http://beets.radbox.org/).

If you wanna use it, grep over the repository for '/mnt/storage' which is the location
of our NAS-based media library, and change it to wherever you want your files stored.

Note that there is a small amount of comic profanity in some files ;)
